Treasure Chest (treasurechest) mod for Minetest

by thefamilygrog66

Description: Adds treasure chests that a server admin can place, and fill with whatever treasures they choose. After the admin adds treasure to the chest, each player who finds it will be able to remove the same items that were originally added by the admin.

Cheers to bark for the idea/concept.
