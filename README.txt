Treasure Chest (treasurechest) mod for Minetest

by thefamilygrog66

Description: Adds treasure chests that a server admin can place, hidden or in plain view, and fill with whatever treasures they choose. After adding treasure to the chest, the admin simply punches it in order to save its contents. When a player finds the chest, they have one (and only one) opportunity to examine its contents, taking what they wish. The chest automatically resets itself every time a new player looks inside, so that every player has access to the same treasure inside. If a player attempts to look inside a second time, they're blocked from doing so, and receive a message indicating that they've already examined its contents.

Cheers to bark for the idea/concept.
